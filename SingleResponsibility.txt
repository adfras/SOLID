The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) declares that a class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should only focus on doing only one thing. One of its important features is project maintainability, which reduces the likelihood of bugs when modular and reusable code is protected within its own class. This allows for better scalability when working with larger projects. Small businesses could benefit from SRP principles by using concise code to reduce errors, improve scalability and cause less headaches.
